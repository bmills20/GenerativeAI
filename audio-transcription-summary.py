"""
    * Define a preprocessing function to extract features from audio data *

    The purpose of the preprocess_function in the code is to extract features from the audio data in the MInDS-14 dataset using the pretrained Wav2Vec2 model and feature extractor.
    The function takes as input a batch of examples from the dataset, which includes audio data in the form of NumPy arrays.
    The function then uses the feature extractor to extract features from the audio data, which are returned as a dictionary of NumPy arrays.
    These features can then be used as input to other machine learning models for tasks such as speech recognition or speaker identification.
    The preprocess_function is called on the dataset using the map() function, which applies the function to each batch of examples in the dataset in parallel.
